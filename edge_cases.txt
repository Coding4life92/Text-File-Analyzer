# Test Case 1: Leading and trailing whitespace, and multiple spaces between words.
# Expected: "start", "middle", "end" should be counted as 3 words.
# The surrounding whitespace should be ignored.

  start   middle      end

# Test Case 2: Punctuation and mixed case.
# Expected: Tests if "Go," and "go!" are treated as "go".
# Your tolower() handles case, but how does isalpha() handle punctuation?
# This will reveal if your word frequency is for "go" (3) or "Go," (1), "go!" (1), "team" (1).
Go, team, go!

# Test Case 3: A file with only whitespace.
# Expected: Character and line counts should be non-zero, but word count must be 0.

  	

# Test Case 4: A single, long word with no spaces.
# Expected: Word count should be exactly 1.
# This also tests that your word buffer doesn't overflow if the word is long.

# Test Case 5: A file ending with a word and no final newline character.
# Expected: This specifically tests the `if (word_buffer_index > 0)` check
# that runs AFTER the main file-reading loop. The word "here" must be counted.
The file ends here
